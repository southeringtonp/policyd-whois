Small postfix-compatible policy daemon to check for recently created
domains.

See install.sh for recommended file locations.

Additional python libraries may need to be installed as well, e.g.:
   sudo pip3 install daemon
   sudo pip3 install sqlite3
   sudo pip3 install whois

You will also need to update your postfix configuration in main.cf
to use the policy engine in smtpd_recipient_restrictions, e.g.,
   smtpd_recipient_restrictions = ..., check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:4444, ...
