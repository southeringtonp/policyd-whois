Small postfix-compatible policy daemon to check for recently created
domains.

See install.sh for recommended file locations.

You will also need to update your postfix configuration in main.cf
to use the policy engine in smtpd_recipient_restrictions, e.g.,
   smtpd_recipient_restrictions = ..., check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:4444, ...
